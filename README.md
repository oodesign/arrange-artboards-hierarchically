# Arrange Artboards Hierarchically (Sketch plugin)

Sketch plugin to arrange artboards hierarchically depending on their name (based on the Sketch Slash naming pattern).

<b> ⚠️  Arrange artboards hierarchically is not supported anymore </b>

## Arrange artboards hierarchically

Simply run "Arrange Artboards Hierarchically" from the Plugins menu.

Arrange Artboards Hierarchically plugin will automatically arrange all artboards in the selected page according to their name (based on the Sketch Slash naming pattern). Something like this:

Note that, for now, artboards need to have a "direct parent artboard" in order to work properly.
In the above example, if the "A1/S1" artboard didn't exist, all of their childs would be arranged directly as "A1" children, at the same level as "A1/S2", "A1/S3", and "A1/S4".

I’d recommend using the vertical approach (arranging them in columns), but there’s an option to have them represented horizontally (in rows) too.
